### Part 2: Front-End Design

Use the mockup in the bottom section to create a front-end application using React.  This should be as pixel-perfect as possible. This include colors, fonts, and whitespace. Ensure your app is responsive for all screen sizes.

_Do not include any JavaScript functionality._

Once the form is submitted, use the API response to display actual weather data for the location submitted in the form.
