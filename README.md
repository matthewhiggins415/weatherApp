# React Weather App

A simple web app to find the weather of any US city. 

## Description
This project is built with React functional components, hooks, and CSS. It leverages an api call to openweathermap.org. 

- My motivation for this porject was to work with React more specifically I wanted to better understand functional components, state and axios api calls in React. 
- I found this project by just googling 'fun react projects' and saw an example. Challenged myself to recreate that example perfectly. The functionality of React combined with CSS styling showcases my frontend skills and I had a lot of fun building it.
- I learned how to (partially) hide my api key using .env file with React. Prepending the .env variable with REACT_APP. Also, I learned more about passing props to child components and got more familiar useState hook.
